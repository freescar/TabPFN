"""The TabPFN v2 model.

Compared to v2 as implemented by the base architecture, this version is missing the
following features which are required for public deployment:
- The base architecture loads the positional embeddings from disk, whereas this one
  generates them using a fixed random seed. Thus, their values may vary from device to
  device.
- This implementation does not support the KV cache.

Note that this version is not compatible with the original checkpoints as layers
have been renamed/restructured.
